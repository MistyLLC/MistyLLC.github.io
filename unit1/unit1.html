  <H3><b>Quick Tips</b></H3>
  
  <p><b><i>Make Ahead: </i></b> Freeze stuffed manicotti without the sauce in an airtight container for up to 1 month.  Defrost; add sauce, then bake as recipe directs in step 4.</p>

<p><b><i>Variations: </i></b> (1) Thaw 1/2 cup frozen shopped spinach and add it to the cheese mixture in step 2 for extra nutrients.  (2) Don't like Italian Sausage?  Simply leave it out of the recipe.  (3) Mince 1/2 cup fresh mushrooms and add it to the cheese mixture in step 2 for extra flavor.</p>
  
  <p><b><i>Helpful Hint: </i></b> Manicotti must be drained very well before it is stuffed.  Otherwise, the filling will become soggy and the sauce diluted.  To quickly and easily remove excess moisture, place drained manicotti on paper towels.</p>
  <p><b><i>Stuffing Hint: </i></b>Don't have time to stuff manicotti shells by hand?  Simply split them lengthwise, spoon in the cheese mixture, then fold over to enclose the filling.</p>
